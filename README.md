‚ö†Ô∏è This is the development branch for future version of CoCart. For current stable branch [browse trunk](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/tree/trunk). ‚ö†Ô∏è

Welcome to the CoCart repository on GitHub. Here you can browse the source of the plugin and packages used in the development of the core of CoCart plugin. You can [look at open issues](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), contribute code and keep track of ongoing development.

We recommend all developers to follow the [CoCart development blog](https://cocart.dev/?utm_medium=github.com&utm_source=repository&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) to stay up to date about everything happening in the project. You can also [follow @cocartapi](https://twitter.com/cocartapi) on Twitter for the latest development updates.

If you are looking for documentation, head over here: [https://docs.cocart.xyz](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=github.com&utm_source=repository&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)

[Click here to download](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce.zip) the latest release package of CoCart.

## What does it provide?

CoCart provides support for managing the user session, alternative options for doing this task do exist; however, their usage can be limited to applications of the same origin as the WordPress installation. This is due to WooCommerce using cookies to store user session tokens.

CoCart provides the utilities to change this behavior during any cart request and passes the required information to HTTP Header so it can be cached client-side. The use of an HTTP Authorization header is optional allowing users to shop as a guest.

## Quick Start

üì¢ This repo is not package ready and must be **built** in order to activate the plugin.

### Step 1

Clone the repo to your WordPress development `wp-content/plugins` folder. Don't forget the folder name `"cocart-dev"` at the end of the command.

```
git clone https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart.git cocart-dev
```

### Step 2

Then go into the cloned folder `cd cocart-dev` and proceed with the following commands.

```
composer install
npm install
composer ready-build
```

Now you will have another folder `cocart` within your plugins folder. This makes CoCart package ready. You will then be able to activate it from your `WordPress Dashboard > Plugins`.

If you have made changes to the core of CoCart and want to test those changes locally, simply run `composer ready-build` and CoCart will be packaged together for you again.

## Updating CoCart Packages

As CoCart is now built modular, to keep up to date with all the development changes in all the default set modules you will need to pull them from their individual repositories.

```
composer update
composer ready-build
```

This will pull the `master` branch of each package which is the development branch unless a tag is specified instead.
