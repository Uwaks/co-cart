## Need Support?

CoCart Lite is released freely and openly. Feedback or ideas and approaches to solving limitations in CoCart Lite is greatly appreciated.

CoCart Lite is not supported via the [WooCommerce Helpdesk](https://woocommerce.com/). As the plugin is not sold via WooCommerce.com, the support team at WooCommerce.com is not familiar with it and may not be able to assist.

If you are in need of support, please [purchase CoCart Pro](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=gh&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

## Bug Reporting
