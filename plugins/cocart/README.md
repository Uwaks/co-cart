# CoCart Plugin

**Important**

Updates for the CoCart plugin on WordPress.org starting on **5th October 2022** will not be getting any further major updates for a long while in order to focus on the paid CoCart Pro version of the plugin. Only minor fixes for bugs will be updated. Don't worry, you'll still be able to use this plugin forever.

Also while API v1 can still be used it will no longer be supported.

**The #1 ecommerce RESTful API built for WooCommerce that scales for headless development.**

## The API

CoCart provides support for managing the user session, alternative options for doing this task do exist; however, their usage can be limited to applications of the same origin as the WordPress installation. This is due to WooCommerce using cookies to store user session tokens.

CoCart provides the utilities to change this behavior during any cart request and passes the required information to HTTP Header so it can be cached client-side. The use of an HTTP Authorization header is optional allowing users to shop as a guest.

#### Cart API

Add **simple, variable** and **grouped products** to the cart by **product ID** or **SKU ID**, update cart items individually or in bulk and more. The flow is simple and returns an updated cart response every time with all the totals calculated and stock checks done for you making it easier to simply update your **UX/UI**.

#### Products API

Access products from your store to display how you like including a number of queries to help you filter by product categories, tags, attributes and more. You can even get posted reviews all without the need to authenticate. All the information you need about a product and it's conditions to help you with your UX/UI development is all provided ready for you.
